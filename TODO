Add microsecond time resolution option (utimes()) for platforms that support such things and make a command line option (linux 2.6, solaris?, ??)

maybe dynamic array should be hash table.

localized messages and time printing

try to use fts() if available instead of nftw

option for max dir. depth?

man page

if more than one file tied for newest,  do what?  print all by default?

let user specify time specific time formatting

make sure configure.in has everything relevant
