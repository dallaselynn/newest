This is to find the newest files in a directory tree, or the oldest, as the case may be, where newest is defined by 'latest mtime' by default.  This can be changed to ctime or atime.  

I'd like to thank FreeBSD 4.11's find for not having printf0, which can also do this quite nicely, and which led me to just say I want my own.
